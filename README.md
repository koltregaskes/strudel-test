# Strudel Test

This project demonstrates a Strudel live-coding setup that recreates
"The Prodigy - Everybody's in the Place". The interface loads the
Strudel audio engine from the internet. If the script cannot be loaded
(e.g. due to lack of network access) the page falls back to showing the
code without sound.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser **with an active internet connection**
and click **Play** to hear the recreation. If nothing plays, check your
network settings or copy the Strudel code into [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc).
